- different mathematical statistics are calculated: 
    - maximum ball height (m)
    - ball velocity in (m/sec)
    - ball angle in degree
    - distance between goal and ball position
    - range of the ball position and ball last distination
    - time of the ball flight
- All of these statistics are displayed on the screen to the user.

## Technology Used:
